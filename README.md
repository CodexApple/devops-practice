# Ghostly's DevOps Journey

##### _My journey on becoming a System Engineer_

#

## On Premise

##### Home Lab

If resource is available, the best start to this approach would be creating your own home-lab (network)
creating a dedicated home-lab boosts the overall confidence when setting up servers and clients
while making every single possible mistake and correcting it with the best practices.

For this home-lab I am planning on learning Ansible or Chef, this would give me another skillset
for learning DevOps, to automate server creation and application deployment using Playbook.

My specifications for home-lab

-   Processor: Intel Core i5 - 8500
-   Memory: 4x16GB DDR4 2666MHZ
-   Storage:
