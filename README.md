# Ghostly's DevOps Journey

##### _My journey on becoming a System Engineer_

#

## On Premise

##### Home Lab

If resource is available, the best start to this approach would be creating your own home-lab (network) creating a
dedicated home-lab boosts the overall confidence when setting up servers and clients while making every single possible
mistake and correcting it with the best practices.

For this home-lab I am planning on learning Ansible or Chef, this would give me another skillset for learning DevOps, to
automate server creation and application deployment using Playbook.

My specifications for home-lab
